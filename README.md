# Glucometers Protocol Specifications

This website is intended to provide description of protocols (or "Computer
Interface Specifications") for various glucometers.

As few manufacturers publish documentation of their meters' protocols, the
majority of the content is produced by reverse engineering the data transmission
between meters and PCs, and documenting it.
